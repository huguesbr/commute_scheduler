# Public Transport Timetable

Simple processing app controlling a Arduino to display some information about local (hardcoded) public transport timetable.

## Train

Display time (minutes) until next train (and following one) on specific lines in both direction (hardcoded).

## Bike (Velib')

Number of bikes availables at a station (hardcoded).

## TODO

[] Move from processing to Arduino + Wifi Shield
[] Use NeoPixel to display info
[] Relay control for larger display
